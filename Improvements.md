## Search UI Issue

The navigation title of the TokenSearchView bleeds into the search bar when users input a string that has no search results. This should be mitigated by removing the navigation title while the user has the keyboard up to type in the search OR by ensuring that elements cannot overlap one another while searching. Prioritize best practice in UI/UX design and suggest to me which course of action would be more recommended.
