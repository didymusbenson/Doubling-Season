## Condensed Condensed View

Even more condensed than current condensed view, only has Tapped/Untapped Power/Toughness no names or anything else. Tap to expand into a larger detailed card (instead of a detail sheet).

## Art Options

### One-time download
Prompt users on first launch to ask them if they want to download token artwork. If they do, run a script that parses all art urls and downloads artwork for the token database. 

If users choose not to download on first load, the settings menu will offer the option to download all art at a later time.

### Import on demand
Acquire token art on-demand by having the user request it on the token details. This will require the user to connect to internet and will download all available artwork for a given token to the user's app data, then ask them which art they want to use. This should allow them to change the token art later as desired.

Import on demand can be implemented whether or not the one-time download is offered.

### User Upload
No internet connection required. User provides their own artwork which is parsed and used for the assigned token, saved to their local token database for their own use.

## Combat
A way to represent tokens in combat? Not sure how we would handle this. Maybe have a combat button that we can assign tokens to a temporary sheet and resolve attacks/blocks etc. Then have it adjust amounts/tapped amounts based on the outcome of combat. 

Combat would also calculate total damage (when possible) or total damage + wildcards based on the tokens that have wildcard p/t.

## General feedback 
Usability is unclear for some players. They tap on "create new" in the reminder text on empty screens, and don't know they can long press things in order to customize how many they add/remove. Controls need to be made more usable and users need easy access to understanding things.

## New Toolbars
Instead of a top banner, a toolbox icon in a bottom left corner bubble of the app that the user can tap to expand into a larger floating toolbox bubble and interact with. It would have the list of tools. The top right corner of the app can have the info tools (about doubling season, help docs etc.)

In this case, move the multiplier to the bottom left of the app? 

In this case, have the container of the bottom tools (multiplier, combat controls, toolbox) be a fading gradient so that tokens "below the fold" disappear under it. There should be padding at the bottom of the last token that's roughly the height of those bottom tools (so that users can scroll up and not have tokens blocked by floating tool buttons).
