| Keep track of my number of tokens and how many counters they have |
| I hate when I have to create multiple tokens of the same that I already have, that are separate and need to be tapped or untapped to start. Based on what I already have, keeping track of what's tapped, not tapped or which ones have summoning sickness without the haste. Such a pain in the ass. |
